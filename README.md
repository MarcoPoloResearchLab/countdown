# Countdown Calendar

The calendar is capable of countdown to a designated date.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so no additional dependencies are required. However, to run
the application locally, you must serve the files over HTTP (browsers often restrict Web Worker usage when using the
`file://` protocol).

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository** or copy the project files (`index.html`) into a directory.

2. **Serve the files using a simple HTTP server.** For example, if you have Python installed, you can run:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Better yet, use a tool like [gHTTP](https://www.github.com/temirov/gHTTP).

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to: http://localhost:8080
